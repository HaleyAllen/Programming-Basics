//  For this problem I would use if else statements to create a code where the
//  computer reads the paragraph and scans for determining words like 
//  First person: I Me My ect. Second: you your ect. Third: He she him her ect.
//  Then Tell the computer if _____ is used the most then _____ othewise ______



//  var first = [I,Me,My,Mine,Ours,Our,We,Myself,Ourself]
//  var second = [You,Your,Yours,Yourself]
//  var third = [She,Her,He,Him,They,Them,Herself,Hers,Himself,His,Themselves,Their,Theirs]

//  if (first > second && third) {
//      console.log("Written in first person.")
//  } else if (second > first && third) {
//      console.log("Written in second person.")
//  } else if (third > first && second){
//      console.log("Written in third person.")
//  }


// The hardest part about problem solving is understanding the problem and also the process of
// coming up with a solution. Once you understand what the problem is/what need to be fixed it
// becomes that much easier to move forward and then when you have come up with your solution
// writing it down or getiing it out to the world is the easy part.
